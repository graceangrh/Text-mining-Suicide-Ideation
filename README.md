# IS450 Text Mining and Language Processing Project: Detecting Suicide Ideation on Reddit
### Team 3

This repository contains all the code that was used to build our models, including pre-processing, training, and evaluation scripts.

## Project Overview

The two NLP tasks that the team is focusing on are:
- Classificiation Model for Suicide Detection
  - This task involves building a classification model that will be able to automatically identify whether a given text contains indication of suicidal ideation. In order to identify the best model, we built three different models - Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine and we will be evaluating the performance of the models before deciding on the best model.
- Sentiment Analysis using NRCLex and VADER
  - This task involves analyzing the sentiments of text data using lexicon-based sentiment analysis tools like NRCLex and VADER. The sentiment scores are then used as features in our classification model.
